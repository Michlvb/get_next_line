# get_next_line

A project at 42.

A function that reads a file and allows to read a line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor. When the function is called again on the same file, it will read the next line.

The project is aimed at understanding memory allocation and when to free memory to prevent memory leaks.
